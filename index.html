              We are Traible, a software company focused on bridging all your communication gaps with the touch of a few fingers! 
              We understand that your company has a vast amount of important knowledge necessary for training, troubleshooting and 
              thoughts. However, these various facets can get lost or gained with a tremendous amount of time. Time that is immensely 
              more valuable if invested in other areas of the company. We aim to fix that. Our program is the most user-friendly 
              database for storing and exploring all your information, including but not limited to processes, formulas, important 
              documents and so much more! All of this is with the intent to bridge all communication gaps.
